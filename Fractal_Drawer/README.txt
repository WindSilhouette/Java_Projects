how to compile and run program: run fractalDrawer.java, type in desired name of shape 

additional features: if user mispells a shape name then they will retry the program

assumptions: the triangles made by the triangle class are isosceles

known bugs: canvas for the fractal doesnt load unless you put it in full screen so it looks like the program didnt work properly off first glance,
a possible known error with the fractal total rectangle area but theres no way to test if its correct or not.
